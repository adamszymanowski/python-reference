# Python Reference
This is my guide to Python and it's libraries/modules.
It's a compilation from official documentation, put in one place.
I will also go through as many reference examples/ tutorial as I can (by hand, typed in, no copying - for learning purposes).

## Python Libraries
External modules (the ones you `pip install`).
- [NumPy]()

## Python Standard Library
Pure Python. It's mostly based on [Python Standard Library official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/).
- [Python (without built-in modules)](https://github.com/adamszymanowski/python-reference/blob/main/python.md)
- [Python built-in modules]()
