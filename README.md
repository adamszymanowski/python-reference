# Python Reference
This is my own guide to Python, that I will use as my own reference. It's mostly based on [Python Standard Library official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/).
Other references (and links to them) are in corresponding files.

It's really a documentation/reference review (or compilation).

This is for my learning purposes.
I will turn entries of this compilation to Anki flashcards, so in many cases I will quote this documentation directly.


## Python Standard Library
Pure Python.
- [Python (without built-in modules)](https://github.com/adamszymanowski/python-reference/blob/main/python.md)
- [Python built-in modules]()

## Python Libraries
External modules (the ones you `pip install`).
- [NumPy]()
