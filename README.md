# Python Reference
This is my own guide to Python, that I will use as my own reference. It's mostly based on [Python Standard Library official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/).
Other references (and links to them) are in corresponding files.

I will most likely turn entries to Anki flashcards, so n some cases I will quote this documentation directly.

## Python Standard Library
- [Python (without built-in modules)](https://github.com/adamszymanowski/python-reference/blob/main/python.md)
- [Python built-in modules]()

## Python Libraries
External libraries (the ones you `pip install`)
- [NumPy]()
